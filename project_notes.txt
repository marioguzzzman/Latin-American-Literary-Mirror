CONCEPT

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotopia_(space)

juxtapose in a single space several incompatible spatial elements
encapsulate  spatio-temporal discontinuities or intensities
presuppose an ambivalent system of opening/closing, entry/ exit, distance/penetration
have a specific operation  in relation to other spaces as, for example, illusion or compensation

https://futurism.media/franz-von-paula-gruithuisen-s-venus-science-fiction
German astronomer Franz von Paula Gruithuisen, became a prominent figure in the nineteenth century, and influenced a generation of sci-fi writers to ponder space exploration to Venus. 

The fascinating story of Franz von Paula Gruithuisen, a German astronomer who became prominent early in the nineteenth century, has inspired sci-fi writers to ponder exploring distant worlds like Mars and Venus. His attempts at explaining the wonders of space were filled with promise of mystery and awe. He was a fairly good observer who concentrated on the moon and the planets, but his imagination was, somewhat vivid. For instance, he discovered what he believed to be an artificial structure on the moon and described it as a collection of dark, gigantic artistic ramparts.  




https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_without_organs
Deleuze first mentions the phrase in a chapter of The Logic of Sense called "The Schizophrenic and the Little Girl", which contrasts two distinct and peripheral ways of encountering the world. The Little Girl (whose exemplar is Alice), explores a world of 'surfaces': the shifting realm of social appearances and nonsense words which nevertheless seem to function. The Schizophrenic (whose exemplar is Artaud) is by contrast an explorer of 'depths', one who rejects the surface entirely and returns instead to the body.

For the Schizophrenic, words collapse, not into nonsense, but into the bodies that produce and hear them. Deleuze refers to "a new dimension of the schizophrenic body, an organism without parts which operates entirely by insufflation, respiration, evaporation and fluid transmission (the superior body or body without organs of Antonin Artaud)."[3] This body is also described as "howling", speaking a "language without articulation" that has more to do with the primal act of making sound than it does with communicating specific words.[4]

//--------------------------------------------------------

Heterotopian 

is it possible to embed an organism with the joined memories of humans and AI?
AI appears to have a mind but not a body, and humans have perceptions that connected to the world may become overwhalmed. 





maybe I can project into a body that is changing, being different. maked with GAN


mirrors, loops

Also de mirror is interesting

thinking about buiding or helping each other understand our world. what does the AI can tell me about the data 


//----------------------- CONCEPT ------------------------------

Dear friends, I am very happy to invite you all this Firday in ACUD, Berlin to explore a new experiment on literature + machine leaning that I've been working on during my stay in the beautiful School of MA.

I've benn training a neural network on XIX century travel literature to become a generative storyteller that may help me to make sense of 

The question that drives the work is: can a neural network, trained in XIX century travel literature, lluminate the experience of a contemporary traveler who is sometimes lost in time and space?


Dear friends, I am super thrilled to invite you this Friday to ACUD, Berlin for the final show of the beautiful School of Machines. I've been developing an experiment on literature + machine learning to become a generative storyteller and answer this question:
 Can a neural network, trained in XIX century travel literature, illuminate the experience of a contemporary traveler, sometimes lost in time and space?

TUTORIAL SPELL

Setup

- make dir
- download the repository = git@github.com:ml5js/training-lstm.git
- enter the repo and = mkdir data
- move input into data 

Training the model

- install spell
- login
- upload the file to spell (rememeber it has to be called input) = spell upload data/input.txt 
- then add the name for the place to store it = NAMEOFFOLDERINSPELL
- go ahead and run the python training file in spell = spell run --mount uploads/NAMEOFFOLDERINSPELL: data "python train.py --data_dir=./data"
- its going to ask to commit = git add . + git commit -m "data added"
- now download our model = spell cp runs/NUMBER OF THE RUN/models
- check them out in data FOLDERNAME

Using the model
- borrow and modify = https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples
